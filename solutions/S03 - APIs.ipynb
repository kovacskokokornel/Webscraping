It is a widespread solution, most of the sites applies this approach to provide their contents. This architecture style is called a **[REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)**. It has three main component:\n","- Client (the javascript code running in the webbrowser)\n","- API (the software running on a server)\n","- Database (the storage solution)\n","\n","The client communicates with the API (but it has no direct access to the database itself) through different commands:\n","- GET: the receive data\n","- POST: to send (and possibly receive) data\n","- PUT: to add new content\n","- DELETE: to remove content\n","\n","Throughout the communication the data is sent in a structured format, generally in [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) or [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML). The client side code is responsible to transform the received data and populate the site.\n","\n","The API will wait for incoming commands in a so called [endpoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture). Some sites tell you about (expose) their endpoint directly - in this case you are encouraged to use them to gather information. Other sites don't but that doesn't mean they are not using one. We are going to use this information for our advantage.\n","\n","##  General algorithm to uncover and exploit REST APIs:\n","\n","__Warning #1:__ Sometimes, the direct usage of APIs is forbidden for commercial purposes. Before you start building a business on it, you might want to read the related terms and conditions of the website. Rare and non-commercial usage should not result in any actions.\n","\n","__Warning #2:__ Not every website uses REST API (or they are restricted in some ways). Therefore, this method will __not__ work in every single case. Sometimes, parsing an HTML is just not something you can avoid. However, it is surely worth checking as you may retrieve the whole dataset without having to parse and clean anything. \n","\n","__Task__: Say you want to scrape the departing flights for a given day from [Budapest Liszt Ferenc Airport](https://www.bud.hu/indulo_jaratok). You need every detail that is accessible.\n","\n","1. Open the [website](https://www.bud.hu/indulo_jaratok), right click and go inspect. On the top bar, instead of browsing the `Elements` tab, change to `Network`. If nothing is displayed here, refresh the page. This will show you the list of network traffic that happens under the hoods. There are pictures here, JavaScript codes and a bunch of scary process that we will avoid, don't worry. You will want to order the requests by `Type`. In most of the cases, `xhr` and `document` types will be the ones we care about. If you click on one of the `xhr` types, this is what should pop up.\n","\n","![micro0](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1AIb9eMa5dmh-vkaijBlaoh7LL7KXnbEM)\n","\n","2. The `Headers` tab shows you the input details of the request that was sent out retrieve this specific content. If you change to the `Preview` or the `Response` tabs, the result of this request will be shown to you. While clicking the former will give you a nicer and rendered look, the latter returns a raw version.\n","\n","3. Now, the task is to find the entry that returns the pieces of flights data we need. Let's check all the ones with `Type` = `xhr` first and check their `Preview` tabs to find the right one. I think we have a winner here, this looks great: \n","\n"," ![micro2](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1c1oPqg3ClrL68lRyGRZBTJQiT-okhUq9)\n"," \n","4. Click on the \"play button looking\" triangle to expand an entry. Okay, this is very cool, we have it.\n","\n","5. Next, we need to find a way replicate it so that we can get the data programmatically. If only there was a way to retrieve the input data for this very request. Oh wait! This is what the `Headers` tab is there for, isn't it? It is!\n","\n","6. Now, the `Headers` tab contains details in a non-Python format (this is not entirely true, but at this point you are not assumed to have the skills needed to transform it manually).\n","\n","7. We are going to transform it with a third party service: https://curl.trillworks.com/\n","\n","8. We need to copy the [curl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL) equivalent of the request by right clicking -> Copy -> copy as curl. At this point, the curl command is copied to the keyboard. Go to https://curl.trillworks.com/ and paste it to the curl command box. This will generate the Python code we can use.\n","\n","![micro3](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1NHA029QlzMjlERnixRkPjFRGFmbXNeXU)\n","\n","9.
